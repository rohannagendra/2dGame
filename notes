Pong - 2D canvas game with HTML5 and JS

//Game loop
	Game loop will, at interval, update and draw each entity.

	The interval is obtained with: 1/FPS


	//simple implementation of game loop
		while (running) {
			update()
			draw()

			sleep(1/fps)
		}

	Sleep in JS:
		setInterval(function(){
			game.update()
			game.draw()
		}, 1000/fps)  //ms per frame


//Game Entity
	Each entity will have position
		X = 10
		Y = 20
	and dimension
		Height = 100
		Width = 100
	and velocity
		X velocity = 5  (move to right)
		Y velocity = -2 (move up)

//Collision detection
	- We will use bounding box collision detection
	- Use position and dimension to form a box around entities and detect collisions.


	intersect  = 	a.y + a.height 	> b.y &&
					a.y < b.y + b.height &&
					a.x + a.width > b.x &&
					a.x < b.x + b.width
